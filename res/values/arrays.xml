        <item>The minimum and maximum values obtained for 11 inverters and 17 inverters are fairly close. The minimum voltages were the same but the maximum decreased by 0.1 V. This may be due to the new chip added powered by 5V Vcc. The addition of new inverters might have affected the results. 

	With 1 inverter, the voltage measured was 1.4 V. 
	
	The significance of the voltage is to show it does not give HIGH or LOW. From the data sheet, the minimum output high voltage is 2.7V and maximum output low is 0.5 V. 
	In addition, the input voltages for minimum and maximum do not fall within range. The voltage measured, 1.4 V is between high and low of input and output voltages because the inverter does not oscillate between high and low.
